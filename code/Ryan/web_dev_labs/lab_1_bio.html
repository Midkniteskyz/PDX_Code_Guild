          <p>The early childhood of Mr. Dirt has yet to be disclosed. We do know that as an infant his skull was left unformed, and his mother made
            the life altering decision to cover his exposed brain with a mullet wig. During development the wig fused with his skull and he has
            been unable to receive a hair cut since.According to Joe, his parents abondoned him at the Grand Canyon at age 8 while he was looking for a can of Grizzly chew. His memory of the
            past is clouded by amnesia, due to multiple head injuries. He does remember having a sister, but does not remember his birth name.<br>
