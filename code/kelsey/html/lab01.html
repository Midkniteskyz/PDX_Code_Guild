    <h1>Muhammad Ali Bio</h1>
    <!-- A written introduction -->
    <h2>Muhammad Ali was a heavyweight boxing champion with an impressive 56-win record. He was also known for his brave public stance against the Vietnam War.</h2>
    <summary>
      Born Cassius Clay Jr. in 1942, Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist and social activist who is universally regarded as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world heavyweight boxing champion in 1964. 
      
      Following his suspension for refusing military service, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title two more times during the 1970s, winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier and George Foreman along the way. Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, Ali devoted much of his time to philanthropy, earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. He promoted his own biopic Ali, starring Will Smith, in 2001. Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. He died the following day at the age of 74.</summary>
